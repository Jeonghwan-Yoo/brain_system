4. Garcia has some serious issues with his short putting. You've
probably been t here yourself. It's not fun. A good putter is a
match for anyone, an old golf saying goes, and a bad putter is a
match for no one. Sergio's got game. His swing is better and he
has evolved into one of the best ballstrikers on tour. You saw it
at Hoylake. He shot 11 under despite some flareups from close
range. He also doesn't look comfortable when he plays with Tiger.
He's 26, so he's got plenty of time to win majors. The only
problem is, to win a major he's got to beat Tiger, who's as good
a putter as anybody in the game. That's a big hill to climb for
anyone, but as fellow golfers, we all sympathize with the short
putt proble. It's such a buzzkill.
